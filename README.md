Sure, here's a short description that you can use to update the README file for your GitHub repository:

Time Series Forecasting with SARIMAX Model
This repository contains Python code for implementing a SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors) model for time series forecasting. The SARIMAX model is used to analyze and predict patterns in time series data, making it a valuable tool in various domains such as finance, economics, and more.

Features
Load and preprocess time series data from CSV files.
Implement the SARIMAX model using the statsmodels library.
Optimize model parameters using grid search and diagnostic checks.
Visualize the original data, predicted values, and residuals.
Interpret model results and make forecasts for future time periods.
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.
Update the time_series_data.csv file with your own time series data.
Run the ARIMAMODEL.py script to fit the SARIMAX model and generate forecasts.
View the model evaluation, visualizations, and predictions.
